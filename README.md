### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Darren Wang
![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/823/maxresdefault.jpg)

Identify myself as a data science enthusiast, my time on GitHub is mostly spent writing Python / R on projects about data analysis/machine learning. You'll also find some fun little web apps I built occasionally. My time off GitHub is mostly spent listening to weird music and searching for more weird music to listen to.

Skills: Python / R / C++ / SQL / Mongo / Neo4J
